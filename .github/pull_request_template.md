# Why

The semantic-form-tree-picker-input in forms allows to render a dropdown where the user can select terms from a vocabulary (called 'scheme') structured as a tree.

The current version of the semantic-form-tree-picker-input has:
-  'tree-patterns' to specify the scheme details ;
-  'nested-form-template' to displays a button (New) that open a modal where the user can create a new term in the vocabulary.

An update of the Semantic Tree Input is requested for the following actions:

- allow the user to easily open the entire Vocabulary in a new frame;
- allow an easy customisation of the term labels when displayed in the vocabulary list or in the selected term.
